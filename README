# HexadecK

This is a prototype of the HexadecK, a virtual hexadecimal keyboard for Android. Enter character codes in hexadecimal micro-chords to type more characters with fewer keys.

The project can be built and deployed with Android Studio. The current implementation does not support simultaneous key-presses, so the first hexadecimal code must be entered on the left and then the second on the right. The current implementation is also portrait only.

## Known issues

- Backspace and newline do not work correctly in some applications.
